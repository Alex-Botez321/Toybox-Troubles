# Toybox Troubles #

## Overview ##

Toybox Troubles is a narrative driven, single-player, noir murder mystery game where it's up to the player to undertake an investigation in a world of toys. Talk to characters, learn their stories and hunt for evidence before you dare to put your thoughts together and attempt an accusation...

## Setting ##

The Toybox is held in the gritty and dark imagination of a sleeping child. As the child sleeps, the toys come to life. However, the bright and colourful facade is not all it seems. The toys start to commit crimes with murderous intent, bringing Detective Bearbones out of slumber. The first case to hit ‘The Toybox’ involves Mrs Fuzzywuzzy, an innocent bear who had recently lost her husband to the evil hands of death. It is Detective Bearbones’ job to solve the murder of Mrs Fuzzywuzzy, and bring the murderer to justice.
